    "This problem of scaling applications (such as a model inferencing server) based on user demand is one that has plagued infrastructure managers since the birth of the modern computer. How do I deploy an application onto infrastructure such that it is available to 100 users during the evening and 100,000 users during the day? Making it available.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem brought about the idea of the **container**, whereby a lightweight instance of an application could be easily spun up and powered down near-instantaneously. By deploying applications in containers, we could better manage the allocation of our compute infrastructure resources at any given time. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, containerization brought about another problem: when there are hundreds of thousands or even **millions** of containers, who (or *what*) is going to spin up and power down these containers based on demand? Enter **Kubernetes**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Kubernetes**, also known as K8s, is an open-source system designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes is like a conductor for a container orchestra*, ensuring everything runs smoothly and efficiently on top of several resource notes (compute and storage servers). Kubernetes groups containers, which are self-contained units of software, into rapidly replicatable logical units for easier management and discovery.\n",
